Game of Life is python app designed using PyGame lib. It is simulation of John Convey's Game of Life.
This is one of the first applications I made in Python

## User Interface

The user interface is made using the PyGame library.


## Languages
App language can be changed if you make changes in "languages.json" value for "language_active".
For serbian change:
"language_active": ["1 Srpski Latinica"]
